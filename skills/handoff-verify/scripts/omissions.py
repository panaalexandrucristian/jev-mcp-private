"""Omission evidence (R03). Stdlib only, read-only: it parses Claude Code JSONL transcripts and files and never executes anything it reads.

A `lost_detail` (a useful detail of the session that the handoff note lost) is confirmed only by a PAIR of Jev verify checks on the SAME write of the note (write_tool_use_id + sha256 +
evaluated_against, `versions.py`): a SOURCE check (the supplied source passage states the detail) and an ABSENCE check (R04: the claim is the bare detail and the complete supplied handoff material gets the
real verdict `unsupported`; R03, historical: the claim "... neither states nor implies this detail: <detail>" verified). Both claims are canonical (built here from one `detail`), the source quote must be exact in the eligible source of the evaluated version, and the evidence given to the absence call must equal the
canonical MATERIAL of the version (the note itself + its direct references, one level, delimited, in order). The CLI `prepare` prints all of it so the model copies, never types, the values; the validator
(jevref.validate_finding) re-derives everything. This module decides nothing semantic: Jev judges the claims; here only provenance, eligibility and completeness are deterministic.

CLI: omissions.py prepare --source ID|PATH.jsonl|opencode:ID|opencode-db:/ABS/DB#ID --file HANDOFF --write-id ID --evaluated-against prefix|session_end --detail TEXT --source-quote QUOTE [--cwd DIR] [--location DIR ...] [--run ID]
  --run = the verification run a session_end evaluation is about (the tool_use id that starts it, listed by `versions.py list` and by this command when several runs follow the write); it is printed in `version_ref.run` and must be copied into every check.
  exit 0 = ready (JSON on stdout), 3 = something is ambiguous or not recoverable (JSON with `reasons`; the omission stays UNRESOLVED)."""

    that moment). A name is what it was bound to at that point: `import_module` is `importlib.import_module` only through `import importlib [as x]` / `from importlib import import_module [as y]` (and plain aliases of
    them), `__import__` only while nothing shadows it, `sys.path.insert/append` only through a bound `sys`. What may or may not run (an `if` whose test is not a constant, loops, handlers, cases, `a and b`, `x if c else y`,
    comprehensions, a definition used as a value or decorated, the methods of a class that is used) is MAYBE, and so is every binding it makes: the alternatives are read apart from each other, each from the state before
    the statement (a loop also after one and two rounds, a handler from a state the body may or may not have reached), and the names they bind are joined conservatively afterwards (`("alt", values)`; an alternative that
    did not bind the name contributes "undefined"), so a branch never installs a certain binding and one branch never sees what another one bound. Inside a function or lambda the names it assigns (`:=` included), imports or defines anywhere are
    local from its start and `unbound` until then (`global` / `nonlocal` send the binding to the module / the enclosing function): a call through a name that is not bound yet demonstrates nothing and is never resolved
    from the outer scope (a MAYBE import when it names a script of the skill). CREATING a callable or an iterator is not running it: a lambda or generator expression that is only built runs nothing (but its defaults / its
    first iterable), a generator function (or a lambda holding `yield`) that is called and discarded runs nothing; when its result is used the body MAY run. Values: ("mod", name), ("def", node, scope, is_async), ("class", methods), ("import",),
