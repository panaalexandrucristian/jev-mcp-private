    the mode of the target, and moved over the canonical target with os.replace. IMMEDIATELY before the replace both the canonical resolution/identity of `path` and the expected hash are checked again: an alias retargeted to another
    file (even one with equal bytes), a replaced target or changed bytes refuse the patch. Any failure (encoding, write, close, replace, retargeting, a changed hash) leaves the target as it was and removes only this operation's own
    temporary file; the backup, once made, stays; an external update is never overwritten or restored. No approval or an initial hash mismatch changes nothing and creates no backup.
