"""Structural validation of a handoff-verify report against scripts/report.schema.json (stdlib only; no network, no Jev call). ONE validator for the report writer (report.bind_report: before any field of a model-written report
is touched), the delivery gate (versions.gate: before it reads the report) and the audit (audit.assess: the structure of the report is part of the audit), so a malformed report is judged the same way everywhere.
It implements exactly the keywords the schema file uses: type (a name or a list of names; `integer` and `number` never accept a bool, `number` never a NaN or an infinity), const, enum, required, properties, additionalProperties
(a schema), items, minItems, maxItems, uniqueItems, minimum, maximum, pattern and a local $ref ("#/$defs/name"). A keyword it does not know is reported, never ignored. Unknown properties are allowed (the schema does not forbid them).
-> list of problems "path: what is wrong" (empty = structurally valid); it never raises on any JSON-like value."""
