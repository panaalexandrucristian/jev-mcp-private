# Changelog

## 0.10.1

- `--http` advertises a static tool list and refuses `subscriptions/listen` in-band: previously a client that opened a listener parked an idle stream on a concurrency slot for its lifetime, and enough listeners could starve the server of slots. Slot accounting no longer leaks on a rejected handler either.
- Docs: the HTTP section names the transport env var and the static tool list.

## 0.10.0

- Opt-in stateless Streamable HTTP: `jev-mcp --http` (or `JEV_MCP_TRANSPORT=http`) serves MCP 2026-07-28 per request and 2025-era clients through the SDK's stateless fallback, with no sessions, on `PORT` (default 8080) at `/mcp`, with `/health`. `HOST` defaults to loopback; binding beyond it is explicit. `JEV_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` gates it with a bearer token and is required unless `HOST` is loopback; Host/Origin rebinding guards answer fixed-string 403s. Concurrent requests are capped at `JEV_MCP_MAX_CONCURRENCY` (default 16) with `429` backpressure, and a cancelled request aborts its in-flight regex worker and Jev calls. Stdio stays the default. Via [#37](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/pull/37) by shivasymbl.
- Stdio now also answers 2026-07-28 clients; 2025-era clients see no change.
- Client-visible provider errors are fixed strings (provider name and status only); upstream response text, including reflected credentials, never reaches tool error content.
- `jev_classify` keeps label ids collision-free and tallies on a null prototype, so labels like `constructor` or `__proto__` can no longer shadow `Object.prototype` or collide with generated ids. Via [#36](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/pull/36) by kittimzhe.
- `jev_verify` no longer mistakes an evidence item literally named `none` for its internal no-source option; the internal key now skips occupied `none_N` ids. Via [#38](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/pull/38) by xujiantop-crypto.
- Internal: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.x replaced by the v2 packages `@modelcontextprotocol/server` and `@modelcontextprotocol/node` 2.1.0; tools are registered once and replayed onto a fresh server per connection or request.

## 0.9.0

- Ships an agent skill inside the package: `skills/jev/` is included in the npm tarball, so coding agents get judgment-tool policy — which tool to call when, fail-closed handling, privacy — without hand-written prompts. Prompted by [#34](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/issues/34) by panaalexandrucristian.
- `jev_extract` keeps multi-letter regex flags (`gi`) intact instead of mangling them into `gig` and throwing. Found in [#34](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/issues/34).
- Internal: zod 4 and TypeScript 7; no tool behavior changes. `tools/list` input schemas gain a `propertyNames` field from zod 4's JSON Schema conversion. Via [#35](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/pull/35).
- Dependency updates: `@jkudish/jev-agent-tools` 0.1.2 and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30.1.

## 0.8.0

- New `jev_noul` tool: batched calibrated probability for stated propositions, labeled likely / unlikely / uncertain. Prompted by [#31](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/issues/31).

## 0.7.0

- Use `@jkudish/jev-agent-tools` for built-in provider selection and direct TypeSafe/Vercel judgments; retain MCP-specific retry and compatible endpoint handling.
- Node.js 22 or newer is required (was 20); the shared wire package declares it.
- Docs: provider setup notes and a pointer to the shared package's add-a-provider guide.

## 0.6.0

- Transport resilience: bounded retries on 408, 429, and 5xx only; ambiguous network failures never retry, so a paid call cannot double-process. Adds a request deadline, a 1 MB body ceiling, and cancellation wiring. Via [#23](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/issues/23) by oppih.
- The typesafe transport routes its SDK through standalone undici to avoid an SDK process-crash bug on cancellation ([typesafe-sdk-js#2](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-js/issues/2)), with a regression test.
- `jev_review` and `jev_gate` now validate score distributions and explain their decision with `reason_codes` and `limiting_rubrics`; a malformed distribution marks the rubric `invalid_response`. Via [#20](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/pull/20) by deadczarvc.
- Strict tool inputs: all ten tools reject unknown arguments and nested keys; a typo is a client error, not a silently missing argument. Via [#19](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/pull/19) by deadczarvc.
- Every tool fails closed on a null or non-object answers envelope instead of crashing; each reports its structured `invalid_response` results.
- `jev_verify`, `jev_screen`, and `jev_find` fail closed on malformed answers: verify marks claims `invalid_response`, screen recommends `review`, find refuses to rank. Via [#8](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/pull/8) by oppih.
- Choice answers are validated by one shared contract across tools; `jev_classify` reports a non-finite confidence as `null` instead of passing it through.
- `jev_extract` uses the shared float-safe sum tolerance, so a 0.33 / 0.33 / 0.33 distribution is accepted like everywhere else.
- Jev-compatible endpoints: `JEV_API_KEY` plus `JEV_API_BASE_URL` runs judgments through any System One-compatible service; error bodies are redacted so the endpoint cannot echo your key. Via [#6](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/pull/6) by Garfielk.

## 0.5.0

- New `jev_review`: score a diff against the request on four rubrics plus safe-to-apply, returning one `auto | review | escalate` action with thresholds you control. Adapted from [burnigtm/jev-mcp](https://github.com/burnigtm/jev-mcp), via [#2](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp/pull/2) by rimusz.
- New `jev_gate`: the completion gate. The same patch review plus up to 16 completion claims checked against caller-supplied evidence in one request, with `reason_codes` for the final action.
- Deliberately excluded: the upstream PR's `jev_coding_loop` agent loop. This package stays judgment primitives that a coding agent calls.
- New `jev_rerank`: one independent relevance probability per candidate in a single request, sorted, ids preserved. Bounded at 250 candidates and a 100,000-character budget.
- New `jev_compare`: same_fact / contradicts / different_facts between two passages, plus optional per-aspect judgments, each with distributions and an auto-versus-review decision.
- New `jev_extract`: your regex finds candidate substrings, Jev picks each field's value, and values return verbatim. Regexes run in a sandboxed worker; zero-match fields skip the model entirely.
- Docs: README restructured around the ten tools, with when-to-call-which guidance and a live-captured `jev_rerank` example.

## 0.4.0

- New `jev_classify`: assign up to 64 items to a shared catalog of up to 250 classes in one batched request. Per-item distribution, confidence, margin, and an auto-versus-review decision; malformed answers surface as `invalid_response`, never uncertainty.

## 0.3.0

- Cloudflare Workers AI support: with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (or `JEV_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` set, judgments run through Cloudflare at the `typesafe/jev` alias; `JEV_PROVIDER=cloudflare` forces it.
- Vercel AI Gateway support: with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` set, judgments run through the AI SDK evaluate API at `typesafe-ai/jev`; `JEV_PROVIDER=vercel` forces it.
- Provider resolution order: TypeSafe direct, OpenRouter, Cloudflare, Vercel.

## 0.2.0

- OpenRouter support: with only an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, all judgments route through OpenRouter's Decisions API (alpha) at the same pricing; `JEV_PROVIDER` forces `typesafe` or `openrouter`.
- Results now report the transport used (`provider`, resolved `model`).

## 0.1.0

Initial release, published to npm as `@jkudish/jev-mcp` (the unscoped `jev-mcp` name belongs to another project).

- `jev_verify`: claims versus evidence with supports / contradicts / says_nothing distributions, confidence, and an auto-versus-review gate.
- `jev_screen`: injection, substance, and relevance probabilities with an advisory pass / review / block / skip recommendation.
- `jev_find`: semantic ranking of up to 250 candidates plus an existence check, no embeddings.
- Token usage and estimated cost on every result.

No versioning policy has been declared yet; treat 0.x APIs as unstable.
